# GAPS Diagram with Chipp.ai Integration - PRD

## Product Overview

An interactive GAPS (Goal, Analysis, Plan, Status) diagram web application that allows users to visually organize their thoughts and goals while receiving intelligent updates from a conversational AI chatbot (Chipp.ai). Users can manually edit the diagram through drag-and-drop interactions, and the chatbot can automatically update diagram contents based on conversations.

## Core Features

### 1. Interactive GAPS Diagram
- Visual 2x2 grid layout with four sections: Goal, Analysis, Plan, Status
- Drag and drop functionality for moving items between sections
- Inline editing of text items
- Add/remove items with intuitive UI controls
- Editable main title
- Accessibility support for keyboard navigation and screen readers

### 2. Chipp.ai Chatbot Integration
- Embedded chatbot interface on the same page
- Chatbot can read current diagram state via API
- Chatbot can send updates to modify diagram contents
- Real-time synchronization between manual edits and AI updates

### 3. API Layer
- RESTful endpoints for diagram state management
- Webhook support for receiving Chipp.ai updates
- Optimistic updates for smooth user experience
- Error handling and rollback mechanisms

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js with React
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **State Management**: React state with optimistic updates
- **Drag & Drop**: Native HTML5 drag and drop with accessibility enhancements

### Backend
- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes
- **Data Storage**: In-memory state (expandable to database later)
- **Integration**: Webhook endpoints for Chipp.ai communication

### Key User Flows

1. **Manual Editing**:
  - User drags item from Status to Analysis
  - UI updates immediately (optimistic)
  - API call saves change
  - On failure, UI reverts with error message

2. **AI Updates**:
  - User talks to Chipp: "I'm behind schedule"
  - Chipp calls API to add item to Status section
  - UI updates in real-time
  - User can continue manual editing

3. **AI Context Retrieval**:
  - User talks to Chipp: e.g. "What's my current status?"
  - Chipp calls API to get current diagram state
  - Chipp responds with context-aware information and/or an updated diagram

## API Specifications

### GET /api/gaps
