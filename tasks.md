# GAPS Diagram Implementation

Interactive GAPS diagram with drag-and-drop functionality, inline editing, and AI chatbot integration.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Project setup with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Jest
- [x] Core TypeScript interfaces (GapsItem, GapsDiagram, API types)
- [x] Utility functions for GAPS operations and data manipulation
- [x] Drag-and-drop functionality between and within sections
- [x] Inline editing for items and main title with Enter/Escape support
- [x] Add/remove item functionality with + buttons and right-click context menu
- [x] Visual drop indicators for drag-and-drop operations
- [x] Hand-drawn axes design with rustic chalk/pencil texture
- [x] Responsive layout with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- [x] Click-to-position cursor editing (like word processor)
- [x] Standard blue drop indicator colors
- [x] Two-panel layout with chat iframe and diagram
- [x] White box design with shadows for cohesive appearance
- [x] Compact title sizing and spacing adjustments
- [x] API endpoints for Chipp AI integration:
  - [x] GET /api/diagram - Returns current diagram state
  - [x] PUT /api/diagram - Updates diagram from AI responses
- [x] Frontend polling to sync with API updates every 3 seconds
- [x] API testing and validation

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Loading state for diagram during AI processing

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Database integration (currently using in-memory storage)
- [ ] User authentication and multi-user support
- [ ] Real-time collaboration features
- [ ] Export functionality (PDF, image)
- [ ] Advanced AI coaching features
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Accessibility enhancements
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large diagrams

## Implementation Plan

### API Integration ✅
The Chipp AI can now interact with the GAPS diagram through two endpoints:

**GET /api/diagram** - Returns current state:
```json
{
  "title": "GAPS Diagram",
  "status": ["In progress", "On track"],
  "goal": ["Finish project", "Learn new skills"],
  "analysis": ["Need better time management", "Good team collaboration"],
  "plan": ["Work 2 hours daily", "Weekly reviews"]
}
```

**PUT /api/diagram** - Updates with new state:
```json
{
  "title": "Updated GAPS Diagram",
  "status": ["Making progress", "Staying focused"],
  "goal": ["Complete project successfully", "Master new technologies"],
  "analysis": ["Time management improving", "Great team dynamics"],
  "plan": ["Daily 3-hour work blocks", "Bi-weekly check-ins"]
}
```

The frontend automatically polls every 3 seconds to sync with AI updates.
