# Chapp Development Tasks

## üö® CRITICAL: TypeScript & Code Quality Issues

### Database Function Inconsistencies
- [ ] **FIX ROOT CAUSE**: `createUser` vs `getUserByEmail` return type mismatch
  - `createUser` returns: `{ id, username, email, passwordHash, isAdmin, ... }`
  - `getUserByEmail` returns: `{ id, username, email, passwordHash, isAdmin, boards: [...], ... }`
  - **Solution**: Make `getUserByEmail` NOT include boards by default, or make `createUser` include them
  - **Impact**: This caused cascading TypeScript errors across multiple API routes

### TypeScript Infrastructure Problems
- [ ] **Define proper interfaces** for all data structures instead of using `any`
- [ ] **Fix database functions** to have consistent return types across all operations
- [ ] **Implement proper error handling** at the source instead of catching everywhere
- [ ] **Use robust state management** patterns instead of null checks everywhere
- [ ] **Create proper TypeScript interfaces** for API request/response formats

### Code Quality Debt
- [ ] **Audit all `any` type usage** and replace with proper interfaces
- [ ] **Standardize error handling** patterns across all API routes
- [ ] **Review null safety patterns** and implement consistent approaches
- [ ] **Document expected data structures** for all database operations

## üîß Development Rules & Accountability

### Rule 1: Root Cause Analysis
**Before applying any fix, ask:**
- Am I treating a symptom or the disease?
- Will this same problem appear elsewhere?
- Is this a one-time fix or a pattern that needs systematic addressing?

### Rule 2: Shortcut Transparency
**When taking shortcuts for immediate fixes:**
- [ ] Document the shortcut in this task list
- [ ] Explain why it's not the ideal solution
- [ ] Note what the proper fix should be
- [ ] Set a timeline for when to revisit

### Rule 3: Pattern Recognition
**If applying the same fix to multiple files:**
- STOP and identify the root cause
- Fix the source instead of treating symptoms
- Update this task list with the systematic fix needed

### Rule 4: Technical Debt Tracking
**Every time we encounter:**
- Repeated error patterns
- Type mismatches
- Inconsistent return types
- Band-aid fixes

**Add to this task list immediately** so we don't lose track of technical debt.

## üìã Current Shortcuts Taken (Need Proper Fixes)

### 1. Error Handling Band-Aids
**What was done:** Added `error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'` to multiple files
**Why it was done:** Quick fix for TypeScript strict mode
**Proper solution:** Implement proper error handling at the source
**Files affected:** Multiple API routes

### 2. Null Check Band-Aids
**What was done:** Added `if (!user) throw new Error(...)` checks everywhere
**Why it was done:** Quick fix for TypeScript null safety
**Proper solution:** Fix database functions to have consistent, non-nullable return types
**Files affected:** Multiple API routes

### 3. Type Annotation Band-Aids
**What was done:** Used `(t: any)` type annotations
**Why it was done:** Quick fix for implicit any type errors
**Proper solution:** Define proper interfaces for data structures
**Files affected:** `src/app/live-test/page.tsx`

## üéØ Next Priority Items

### Immediate (When Ready)
- [ ] Fix `createUser`/`getUserByEmail` return type mismatch
- [ ] Define proper interfaces for all data structures
- [ ] Audit and fix all `any` type usage

### Medium Term
- [ ] Implement proper error boundary patterns
- [ ] Standardize API response formats
- [ ] Add comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

### Long Term
- [ ] Implement robust state management
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Create development guidelines document

## üìù Notes

**Last Updated:** After TypeScript fixes session
**Current Status:** App works but has technical debt
**Priority:** Fix root causes when time permits, but app is functional for now
